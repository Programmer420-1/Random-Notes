## Why did we choose this case study
<p>The flash floods have brought heavy losses, including losses of life and property damages which often require a lot of effort and financial resources to revert the affected area to how it was before the flood. For instance, Malaysia has suffered an estimated loss of RM6.5 billion due to the flash floods which took place in Klang Valley in March 2022. Hence, we will like to bring our solution to help the current government to tackle this issue in a 21st century way.</p>  


## Problem statements
As the occurrence of flash floods are often caused by many reasons and will bring a lot of problems during the flood, we will segment this case into 3 parts based on the time of the flood.

### Pre-flash-flood
  1. Clogged drain
      - Clogged drain is usually the main reason for the occurrence of flash floods despite the existence of a great drainage system. The clogged drain will lower the effectiveness of the drainage system, causing the accumulation of rainwater which will lead to flash floods. 
  2. Intense rainfall over a short period of times
     - High density of rainfall is also one of the culprits that caused the flash floods. This is due to the amount of rainfall has exceeded the designed capabilities of the drainage system installed for the region.
### Intra-flash-flood
 1. Trapped in the flood
     - When the victims are unable to evacuate from the affected area in time, they will be trapped in the flood region due to the high flood level. Furthermore, there will be disabled communities and the elders who have mobility difficulties involved in the flood. They are most likely to be trapped when a flash flood takes place.
 2. Difficulty in locating the exact location of victims
     - The rescue team always has difficulty locating the victims who are trapped in the flood region as they are unable to make sure which house has trapped victims and which doesn't. Hence reducing the efficiency of the rescue team.
 3. Difficulty in requesting help from the public 
     - The victims may use several social media platforms to request help in times of crisis. However, other news feed will wash down their help requesting posts in a very short time which then causes their requests for help to be ignored by the public.
### Post-flash-flood
 1. Inefficient delivery of donations
     - Problem will arise due to the absence of a platform that centralized all of the reputable organizations that are capable to deliver the donations or daily necessities to the victims. This is because the public is unable to reach out to the organizations easily, causing the delivery of donations to be postponed.  
 2. Unreasonable distribution of human resources for recovery work 
     - We also notice a situation where there are way more organisations doing a cleanup in one area, overcrowding the place thus making the cleanup ineffective and wasting tons of resources. The potential problem could be ineffective communication between each party where they held their cleanup campaign in Telegram, but not a unified platform. 


## Proposed solutions
For the problems mentioned above, we have designed a mobile app with a lot of features that can cater for them. The mobile app is designed to be elderly-friendly and easy to use.
### Pre-flash-flood
  1. Report channel
      - Allow users to report clogged drains and leaking pipes which can be used to inform authorities to act on the issue
      - Public can put pressure on the government and oversee the progress made by the government
  2. Weather prediction
      - Accurate and clean weather information that allows users to prepare for the flash flood beforehand
      - Notification will be sent to alert users if the probability of flash flood is high
### Intra-flash-flood
  1. Centralized platform for help requests
     - Our solution acts as a centralised platform that allows users to seek help. Those who are interested in providing help can also use our solution as a guide. GOs and NGOs can also easily target needy people and act quickly without having to search through every social media post.
  2. Locate the victims in the flood area with ease
      - With the beacon mode which is available in our solution, the victims' location will be exposed to all the other users in the app. Hence, this makes the rescue team able to locate and extract them from the flood region in a shorter time and does not need to search houses by houses.
### Post-flash-flood
  1. Centralized platform for organizing and participating in the recovery events
      - Organisers can hold charity events such as soup kitchen and clean up activities
      - Helpers can obtain the information of any charity event easily and can participate in the event with only a click on the “Register” button.
  2. Centralized platform for the organization to aid in the delivery of donations
      - Reputable organizations can register an account using our solution to allow the public to reach out to them easily.
